## Installing Proofing Tools on an Administrative Installation Point
 
If you want to deploy Microsoft Office 2003 Proofing Tools to multiple computers on your network, you can create an administrative installation point on a server. This will copy the files from the CD to a shared folder that users can access. To install Office 2003 Proofing Tools on an administrative installation point, follow these steps[^2^]:
 
1. On a server, run Ptksetup.exe with the /a command-line option from the Office 2003 Proofing Tools CD.
2. When prompted, enter the installation location and product key, and then click Next.
3. Accept the end-user license agreement (EULA), and then click Next.
4. Click Install.

## Installing Proofing Tools on a Client Computer
 
If you want to install Microsoft Office 2003 Proofing Tools on a single computer, you can run Ptksetup.exe from the CD or from the administrative installation point. To install Office 2003 Proofing Tools on a client computer, follow these steps[^2^]:

1. Run Ptksetup.exe from the CD or from the administrative installation point.
2. When prompted, enter the product key, and then click Next.
3. Accept the EULA, and then click Next.
4. Select the languages that you want to install, and then click Next.
5. Click Install.

## Customizing Proofing Tools Installation
 
You may want to omit a language feature from a proofing tools installation or make other customizations when you install proofing tools with Office. Using the Custom Installation Wizard to create a transform (MST) file, you can customize an installation that includes settings for the language features you want users to install. Users will receive these customizations when they install proofing tools using this transform[^2^]. To create a transform to customize an Office 2003 Proofing Tools installation, follow these steps[^2^]:

1. Start the Custom Installation Wizard.
2. When prompted for an MSI file, enter (or browse to) the Ptk.msi file from the administrative installation point or from the CD.
3. Select your customization options on each page of the wizard.
4. Save your transform file with a unique name.

To apply your transform file when installing proofing tools, use the /t command-line option with Ptksetup.exe. For example:

    Ptksetup.exe /t MyTransform.mst
